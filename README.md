# 🚗 License Plate Recognition System (LPRS)
A computer vision-based License Plate Recognition System (LPRS) built using OpenCV and deep learning. This project detects license plates in vehicle images and extracts the alphanumeric text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).


# 🔍 Overview
This project implements a License Plate Recognition System using image processing and machine learning techniques. It processes input images or video, detects the license plate region, and uses OCR to read the plate number.

It can be applied in:

Parking management systems

Law enforcement

Toll collection

Vehicle tracking systems

# ✅ Features
License plate detection using YOLO/OpenCV Haar cascades

Text recognition with Tesseract OCR

Real-time video stream support

Plate extraction and saving results in text files or database

Easy to extend for multiple regions (custom training supported)

# 🧠 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

Tesseract OCR

YOLOv5 / Haar Cascade Classifier

Numpy / Pandas

Streamlit (optional, for UI)
